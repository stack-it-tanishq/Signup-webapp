Build a single-page, mobile-responsive landing site using Next.js + Tailwind CSS for a fitness & physiotherapy booking platform.

Design goals: clean, modern, calm, trustworthy, conversion-focused. Rounded corners, subtle shadows, generous white space, smooth scrolling, and small micro-interactions on hover/in-view.

Color palette (use as Tailwind custom colors / CSS variables and apply consistently):
• Primary (teal): #3FB6A8
• Secondary (sky blue): #4FA3D1
• Accent (coral for CTAs): #FF6F61
• Background (off-white): #FAFAFA
• Text (charcoal): #333333

Typography: modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter). Maintain strong hierarchy (H1 → H3, body, small).

Accessibility: high contrast, focus states, aria-* labels, keyboard-navigable, descriptive alt text.

Page structure (one page, anchored sections):

Sticky Nav (logo left, right-side links: Problem, Benefits, Solution, How It Works, Why Us, Trust, FAQ; CTA button “Join the Waitlist” scrolls to form).

Hero (split layout):

H1: “Safe, Personalized Strength & Mobility Training — At Your Home”

Subhead (1–2 lines).

Email capture (input + primary Accent CTA button).

Support text: “No spam. Unsubscribe anytime.”

Right: illustrative image placeholder (physio training a client at home).

Problem (brief paragraph + 3 bullets).

Why This Matters (3 benefit cards with icons).

Our Solution (split layout: image left, text right; 3 bullets: Safe, Convenient, Effective).

How It Works (4 horizontal step cards with icons: Tell us about you → Match with verified physio-trainer → Book conveniently → Train & track progress).

Why We’re Different (4 feature cards: Only certified physiotherapists, Safety-first programs, Transparent pricing, Local consistent support).

Trust Builders (logo strip placeholders + short credibility statements).

FAQ (accordion with 4–6 Q&As; e.g., Is this safe with knee pain? Do I need equipment? Can I choose my trainer?).

Final CTA (big headline, subheadline, email capture form again, privacy note).

Footer (logo, mini nav, copyright, placeholder links).

Behavior & UX details:
• Smooth scroll to sections.
• Animate section reveal on scroll (small translate/opacity).
• Button/CTA hover states; focus rings for accessibility.
• Sticky nav changes background on scroll.

Form handling:
• Validate email on client side; on submit, mock API (/api/subscribe) that logs/stores to a local JSON file or prints to console, then show success toast/state.
• Disable button while submitting; show inline error for invalid email.

Tech setup:
• Next.js App Router, Tailwind configured with custom theme colors from palette.
• Components folder with: Nav.tsx, Hero.tsx, Problem.tsx, Benefits.tsx, Solution.tsx, HowItWorks.tsx, Differentiators.tsx, Trust.tsx, FAQ.tsx, FinalCTA.tsx, Footer.tsx.
• Reusable Container and SectionHeading components.
• Icons via react-icons (placeholders OK).
• Simple toast via a lightweight library or custom.
• SEO: <head> with title, meta description, Open Graph tags, favicon placeholder.

Styling guidance:
• Background overall: #FAFAFA.
• Headings/text: #333333.
• Primary UI accents (links, highlights): teal #3FB6A8.
• Secondary elements (dividers, subtle badges): sky blue #4FA3D1.
• CTAs (all primary buttons): coral #FF6F61 with white text; hover → slightly darker coral, focus ring teal.
• Cards: white surface, soft shadow, 12–16px radius.

Sample copy (use placeholders, but wire real text slots):
• Hero subhead: “We connect you with certified physiotherapist-trainers who understand your body and goals—so you can get stronger, stay active, and live pain-free.”
• Problem headline: “Fitness that ignores your health history can do more harm than good.”
• FAQ example Q: “Do I need equipment?” A: “Not necessarily—your trainer will adapt to what you have.”

Deliverables:
• A working Next.js project with all sections on /.
• Tailwind theme extended with the palette.
• Mock /api/subscribe route that accepts { email }.
• Clean, commented code; easily swappable content (a content.ts or content.json is great).
• Looks polished on mobile and desktop.
