They'll assess your condition, design safe modifications, and help you build strength without aggravating existing issues. Many of our clients actually find relief from chronic pain through our programs."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need equipment?",
        answer: "Not necessarily—your trainer will adapt to what you have. We start with bodyweight exercises and everyday items like water bottles or towels. If you want to invest in equipment, your trainer can recommend affordable options based on your goals and space."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I choose my trainer?",
        answer: "Yes! We'll match you with 2-3 qualified trainers based on your needs, location, and preferences. You can review their profiles, read about their specialties, and choose who feels like the best fit. If you're not completely satisfied, we'll help you find a different trainer."

      {
        question: "How much does it cost?",
        answer: "Our sessions are competitively priced compared to traditional personal training, but offer much more value through healthcare expertise. Pricing varies by location and session frequency. We'll share exact pricing when we match you with local trainers. No contracts or hidden fees—pay as you go."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I'm a complete beginner?",
        answer: "Perfect! Our trainers excel at working with beginners because they understand how to build strength safely from the ground up. You'll start with basic movements and progress at your own pace. Many of our clients had never exercised regularly before starting with us."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you ensure trainer quality?",
        answer: "All our trainers must hold current physiotherapy licenses, pass background checks, and complete our safety certification program.
